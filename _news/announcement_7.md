I will co-chair the [IMPACT 2024](https://impact-workshop.org/) workshop with Prof. [Corinne Ancourt](http://ancourt.net/). It is the 14th edition of this workshop, which will be held in conjunction with the [HiPEAC 2024](https://www.hipeac.net/2024/munich/#/) conference in Munich, Germany between January 17 and January 19, 2024. Please consider to submit your best polyhedral work to the workshop!
