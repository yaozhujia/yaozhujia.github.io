One paper titled "Modeling the Interplay between Loop Tiling and Fusion in Optimizing Compilers using Affine Relations" was accepted by [ACM TOCS](https://dl.acm.org/journal/tocs). We are so fortunate to be the authors of one of the last round of TOCS publications since this journal is no longer accepting submissions and will cease publication after 2023.
