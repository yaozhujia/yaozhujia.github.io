One paper titled "Optimizing Deep Learning Inference Efficiency through Block Dependency Analysis" has been accepted by [ASPLOS 2025](https://www.asplos-conference.org/asplos2025/). Today is the Chinese New Year 2025 Eve, i.e., the Year Eve of the Green Snake. Many thanks to my co-authors of this paper.
